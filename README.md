# java-development-journey
A personal journey of learning Java fundamentals, SOLID principles, and building projects step by step.

**Welcome to my **Java Development Journey!**  
This repository is where I practice Java fundamentals, explore object-oriented programming (OOP), and apply principles like **SOLID** to build cleaner, smarter projects.  

---

## What’s Inside
- Java basics (variables, loops, basic data structures, methods)
- Object-Oriented Programming (classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism)
- SOLID principle practice projects
- Mini projects for hands-on learning
- Future experiments with advanced Java concepts


## 🎯Goal
To document my progress in Java, build a strong foundation, and eventually create bigger real-world applications. Mistakes are part of the journey and that’s how I grow as a developer. 

---

## 🛠️ Tools I’m Using
- **Java JDK**
- **IntelliJ IDEA** 
- **Git & GitHub** for version control

---

## 🤝 Contributing
This is mainly a personal learning repo, but recommendations and feedback are always welcome.

## 📌 Note
This repository is a work in progress. I’ll keep in touch as I learn more about Java and software development.
